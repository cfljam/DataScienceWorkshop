# Preliminary Agenda

# Day 1

## Intro and welcome, 8:50

## Session 1, 9:00-10:30

*Exploring 1:*

* 9:00-9:30 Shannon Schlueter: **Universal Data Science Challenges: Perspective from Disparate Data Domains.**
Data science is largely a domain agnostic discipline. Best practices and novel solutions to once intractable challenges are routinely gleaned from seemingly disparate data domains. Methodologies once rarely identified outside of the realm of bioinformatics and computational biology are now commonly used to address challenges in fields such as image recognition and social sentiment analysis. But is this synergy mutually beneficial? Can the life sciences and bioinformatics claim benefit from practices found in other data rich domains?

* 9:30-9:50: Finlay Thompson (Dragonfly): Data Science Practice in the Real World

* 9:50-10:10: Bruno from Catalyst

* 10:10-10:30: Talk 4

## Morning tea, 10:30–11:00

## Session 2, 11:00-12:30

*Application 1:*

* 11:00-11:30: Charles Unsworth: **Artificial Neural Networks & Machine Learning for Neural Applications.**
In the first part of the seminar, I will discuss how we have applied ANNs for the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the in vivo firings of insect olfactory neurons. In the second part of the seminar, I will discuss how we have applied Machine Learning approaches to identify Sharp wave transients in the EEG in order to aid the early detection of Hypoxic Ischemia in Newborn Infants.

* 11:30-11:50: Talk 2

* 11:50-12:10: Talk 3

* 12:10-12:30: Talk 4


## Lunch, 12:30-1:30

## Session 3, 1:30-3:00

*Exploring 2*

* 1:30–2:00 Bob Durrant: **Random Projections for Dimensionality Reduction.**
Linear dimensionality reduction is a key tool in the statistician's toolbox, used variously to make models simpler and more interpretable, to deal with cases when n<p (e.g. to enable model identifiability), or to reduce compute time or memory requirements for large-scale (high-dimensional, large p) problems. In recent years, /random/ projections (RP), that is projecting a dataset on to a k-dimensional subspace ('k-flat') chosen uniformly at random from all such k-flats, has become a workhorse approach in the machine learning and data mining fields, but it is still relatively unknown in statistical circles. In this talk I will explain (in a fairly math-lite/high level way) some key theoretical grounds for why this approach, perhaps rather surprisingly, can be a very effective addition to the statistician's toolbox.

* 1:30-1:50 Talk 2

* 1:50-2:10 Talk 3

* 2:10-2:30 Talk 4


## Afternoon tea and student prize giving, 3:00-3:30


## Session 4, 3:30-5:00

*Application 2:*

* 3:30 – 4:00 Richard Newcomb: **Data to do with smell**
Smell is one of the most complex of our senses. Thousands of odours, hundreds of receptor genes, a few sensory perceptions and all with just one nose. In this talk I outline how we have used analysis and visualisation of data from genomes and odour space to unravel how odours are perceived in insects and humans

* 4:00-4:20 Talk 2

* 4:20-4:40 Talk 3

* 4:45-5:30 Poster Session

## Practical Demonstrations:

* ShinyR

* D3

* Dragonfly on reproducible research

# Day 2


## Morning session, 9:00-12:00
###  Option 1: Shannon Schlueter: Synergy from Heterogeneous Data

This session will expand on Shannon’s presentation around data from disparate sources and the concept of machine learning. You will learn to use machine learning and big data approaches particularly R machine learning, big data search engine (spark) and speech recognition libraries (NLTK).

### Option 2: PFR Biometrics Team: Data Visualisation

RP is thankfully an area where theory and findings in practice are often fairly closely aligned. They are not a dark art, however some practitioners seem to have unrealistic expectations of what they can achieve with a naive single-shot application of RP.

* generating insight into what RP does, with several different views of what is going on (each of which may help with interpretation).

* guidelines for making RP work well for the practitioner, with (sometimes) links back to theory to motivate them.

* a few shortcuts and speedups that seem to work well in practice, with (usually) links back to theory to motivate them.

* different types of RP matrix and how to generate them.

* some hands-on play with a challenging publicly available dataset (gene array data, n = O(10), p = O(1000)) at a classification task using RP as an enabling tool.

## Afternoon session 1:00-4:00

###  Option 1: Shannon Schlueter: Machine learning with Apache Spark

[ADD DETAILS]

### Option 2: NeSI: High performance computing using the new NeSI HPC cluster.

This session will cover a range of aspects regarding research data, in particular large scale data. We will cover best practices around storage and management of big datasets (including Data Management Plans) and advantages of storing research data within the compute infrastructure such as the one provided by the New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI). We will discuss main caveats regarding handling large-scale datasets for research. NeSI will also present its planned data services and solutions."
